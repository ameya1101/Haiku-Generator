# Haiku-Generator
A RNN-based model that generates a haiku.

# Data
The dataset to train the model was scraped from http://haiku.somebullshit.net/ which is an extensive database of haikus written on reddit. Around 2000 haikus were used to train the model, and this can be found in the `haiku_reddit.tsv` file.
